# SDG-Discord-Bot
A multipurpose bot for a private Discord server.

Getting started:

You'll need Visual Studio, Python 2.7 (or higher) and NodeJS (Version 4 or higher).
You can follow this guide to getting discord.js going on your machine -
http://discordjs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html

**When you type "npm install..." do it in the windows command prompt, not node.

To run the bot:

Open CMD and type -
node "file path goes here.js"

**I type node and then just drag the .js file into the CMD window to make it easier.
